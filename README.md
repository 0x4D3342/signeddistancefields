# Signed Distance Fields

Welcome to the signed distance fields repo. This contains the WIP sample code for the blog post https://shaderfun.com/2018/03/23/signed-distance-fields-part-1-unsigned-distance-fields/

Once the post series is complete, I'll clean it up and turn it into a handy unity package for anyone who wants to get started with SDFs!
