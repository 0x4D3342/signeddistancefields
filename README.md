# Signed Distance Fields

Welcome to the signed distance fields repo. This contains the sample code for the signed distance field series at https://shaderfun.com/. 

Whilst the repo is focussed on the blog, it is designed to be a simple toolkit for generating and rendering signed distance fields. Currently it is focussed on 2D fields, and supports:
- Rendering a field texture on screen using a variety of different demo algorithms
- Generating a distance field from explicit primitives such as circles, lines, rectangles
- Generating a distance field from an image, with simple handling for anti aliased images
- Sweeping a field using either 8PSSDT sweep or a brute force eikonal algorithm
- Downsampling
- Softening

Enjoy!
